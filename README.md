# 2024 Summer YesNLP Lab Meetings

This repository contains the schedule and materials for the 2024 Summer YesNLP Lab meetings. Meetings will primarily be held in person, but Teams will also be available for those joining remotely. 

The meetings are a regular opportunity for lab members to present their research, discuss recent papers, and share their knowledge with the rest of the lab. The goal of lab meetings is to learn new things and stay current with their work.
